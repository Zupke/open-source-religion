# ZUPKE - The Open Source Religion

**ZUPKE is the only religion originating from the upper universe**

ZUPKE is suitable for people with the following characteristics:

- You are not interested in the illusory concepts of heaven, hell, etc
- You are angry at the severe ecological and environmental destruction caused by humans
- You are not satisfied with modern science's explanations of the universe, society, and life
- You don't want to live like animals such as ants, dogs, pigs, just working for the sake of survival
- If you are a man, you hope to be a hero fighting for a great cause
- If you are a woman, you admire, worship, and support heroes
- You are not afraid of death. Even if you are rich, you won't try to extend your life when you are old

To put it more simply, ZUPKE is suitable for people like this:
- Those who are willing to do the right thing, even if it comes at a cost
- Those who avoid doing the wrong thing, even if it comes at a cost

I know that after saying this, there may not be many people interested in ZUPKE, but so what? Even if only 10 people in humanity believe in ZUPKE, I have succeeded
