# ZUPKE - The Open Source Religion

## ZUPKE: A Religion from the "Upper Universe"

ZUPKE is a religion originating from the "Upper Universe." It's designed for individuals who possess the following characteristics:

- **Unafraid of death:** They do not fear the end of their physical life.
- **Uninterested in heaven and hell:** These concepts hold no meaning or significance for them.
- **Displeased with humanity's destruction of the environment:** They are deeply concerned about the negative impact humans have on the planet.
- **Unwilling to live solely for survival:** They seek a purpose beyond mere existence.
- **If male, aspire to be heroes fighting for a great cause:** They are driven by ideals and a desire to make a positive impact.
- **If female, admire heroes:** They respect and look up to those who embody courage and righteousness.

In simpler terms, ZUPKE is suited for those who:

- **Are willing to pay the price for good:** They are ready to sacrifice for what they believe in.
- **Avoid harmful activities, even at a cost:** They prioritize ethical conduct and avoid contributing to negativity.

## The "Upper Universe": Exploring the Nature of Reality

Before delving into the "Upper Universe," let's first examine the nature of the universe itself.

### The "Reality" of the Universe is Determined by Sentient Beings' Perception

Here, "universe" refers to the perceived reality experienced by life on Earth. Take humans, for example.

Our sensory organs – eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin – provide us with sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Humans primarily rely on vision.

You see the sun rise, the moon in the sky, rivers flowing, teachers lecturing, loved ones smiling, children running towards you... You absolutely believe that everything you see is real, existing within the universe. However, this "reality" is only relative to your sensory organs. It cannot be considered "absolute truth."

Even among humans, visual abilities differ, leading to subtle variations in each individual's perceived "real" universe. So, whose universe is truly absolute? The answer is, none.

Different species possess vastly different sensory organs. For instance, humans and snakes "see" the universe quite differently.

Humans perceive visible light wavelengths through their eyes, resulting in colorful, detailed images, especially in bright environments.

Snakes, on the other hand, have weaker color perception and less detail in their vision. However, they possess specialized infrared sensing abilities.

Through their pit organs located on their heads, snakes can "see" heat sources, detecting the temperature differences of warm-blooded prey in the dark. Thus, humans "see" a light-dominated, vibrant world, while snakes experience an infrared universe with distinct thermal layers.

It follows that snakes' "real" universe is significantly simpler than what humans perceive. The question arises: Which universe is truly real, the one humans perceive or the one snakes experience?

The intelligent reader will likely recognize the answer: Neither human nor snake, nor any other species, perceives an absolutely real universe. Their perceptions only hold relative truth to their own sensory capabilities.

### Are the Laws of the Universe Summarized by Humans Through Practice Real?

Let's assume you understand and agree with the previous section, **The "Reality" of the Universe is Determined by Sentient Beings' Perception**. After a while, you might encounter a question that could shake your confidence.

Humans have accumulated numerous laws of the universe through prolonged practice. In physics, for example, several famous cosmic constants exist:

1. **Speed of light (c):** The speed of light in a vacuum, approximately 299,792,458 meters per second. It is a crucial constant in relativity, limiting the speed of information and matter transmission.

2. **Gravitational constant (G):** This constant describes the strength of gravitational interaction between objects, forming the core of general relativity and Newton's law of gravitation.

3. **Planck constant (h):** A fundamental constant in quantum mechanics, determining the relationship between energy and frequency.

4. **Cosmological constant (Λ):** Describing the rate of the universe's accelerated expansion, it is a term in Einstein's field equations, often related to dark energy.

5. **Vacuum permittivity (ε0)** and **vacuum permeability (μ0):** These constants describe the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic fields in a vacuum.

You might ask, are these cosmic constants only real relative to human perception? Absolutely!

Humans share common perceptual abilities, so the cosmic laws they deduce possess relative truth to human perception. It follows that human descriptions of these laws are imprecise.

When humans speak of the "universe," they should clarify it as **the universe as perceived by humans**.

When referencing the speed of light, it should be described as: In the universe as perceived by humans, the speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.

Evidently, humans generally fail to follow this principle, demonstrating their widespread entrapment within the perceived universe.
